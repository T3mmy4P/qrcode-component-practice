## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I developed a better understanding of how to position containers, especially vertical centering using flex design and it's properties. 

Example;

```css
section {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 80vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

Practised using media queries for responsive design (although it wasn't used as part of the final code, the inital exploration of the subject has enlightened me to new design possiblities and how to implement them using media queries).



### Continued development

I hope to continue to improve my CSS skills and expand my knowledge on implementing flex and media queries for responsive design.



### Useful resources

- [Mimo](https://www.mimo.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flex. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to improve their coding knowledge and skills.
