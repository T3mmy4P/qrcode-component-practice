## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I developed a better understanding of how to position containers, especially vertical centering using flex design and it's properties. 

Example;

```css
section {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 80vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

Practised using media queries for responsive design (although it wasn't used as part of the final code, the inital exploration of the subject has enlightened me to new design possiblities and how to implement them using media queries).



### Continued development

I hope to continue to improve my CSS skills and expand my knowledge on implementing flex and media queries for responsive design.



### Useful resources

- [Mimo](https://www.mimo.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flex. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to improve their coding knowledge and skills.
